## Using Gradle

The project is built using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).
The [Gradle build script](../build.gradle) is also responsible for static analysis,
testing, and measuring code coverage.

### Command line

You can run Gradle tasks from the command line using the following command:

    ./gradlew build

`gradlew` is a Gradle wrapper that knows how to find and, if necessary, download Gradle.
